# File Organization Script

## Overview

The File Organization Script is a Python application designed to organize files in a specified directory based on their file extensions. It automates the process of creating folders for different file types and moving files into their respective folders. The script performs the following tasks:

1. **Organizes Files**: Moves files into folders based on their extensions.
2. **Creates Folders**: Automatically creates folders for each file type found.

## How It Works

1. **Setup Directory**: Place your files in a directory where you want them to be organized.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the `organizer.py` script in the terminal.
3. **File Organization**: The script will:
   - Create folders for each unique file extension.
   - Move files into the appropriate folders based on their extension.
